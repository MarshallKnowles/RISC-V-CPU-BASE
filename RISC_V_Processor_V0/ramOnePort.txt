This file is a placeholder for the RAM unit used in this project.
It is replacing the RAM unit because I used a quartus IP block to instantiate the RAM and 
as Altera/Intel IP does not follow the same license as my project I will not be including it here.

I will however, provide the settings I used to create the block such that it may be 
recreated by anyone regardless of IP usage.
The following are the settings I used to set up the IP block:

Device Family: MAX10
Output bus width: 32 bits
Memory Capacity: 32b x 256 words
Memory Block Type: Auto -> M9K
Max Block Depth: Auto -> >= 256 words
Clocking Method: Single Clock
Registered Ports: address, byteEn, dIn, wren
CKE (clock enables): None
byte enable for port A: Yes -> byte enable for dIn and memDout
aclr (asynch clear for registered ports): No
rden (read enable): No
Single Port Read-During-Write Option: 
	when being written to memDout = new data.
	If bytes are masked X's are written to masked bits.
	This setting is chosen for debugging purposes and can be safely changed to: don't care.
Memory Initalization: None (memory is left as all 0s)
In-System Memory Content Editor: Not allowed.
